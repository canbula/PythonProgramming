# About
Repository for the project assignment to be carried out within the scope of Python Programming course given at Manisa Celal Bayar University, Department of Computer Engineering.

# Project Information
Repository for the Python Programming course given by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Bora Canbula at Manisa Celal Bayar University Computer Engineering Department. "Engauge Digitizer" application was selected as one of the project topics for the Python Programming course. This repository was created to realise the task of making a similar application to the existing application within the scope of the project to be done.

# Engauge Digitizer
The Engauge Digitizer tool accepts image files (like PNG, JPEG and TIFF) containing graphs, and recovers the data points from those graphs. The resulting data points are usually used as input to other software applications. Conceptually, Engauge Digitizer is the opposite of a graphing tool that converts data points to graphs.

The process is shown below - an image file is imported and then digitized within Engauge by placing points along axes and curves. Data points can be transferred to other software applications by exporting to a text file, or directly using copy and paste. Work can be saved into an Engauge DIG file for later editing.
