# Cyberduck Clone Project
This project aims to create a web version of the popular Cyberduck application as part of a university project. Our team worked collaboratively to build this project, focusing on both the frontend and backend components.

## Project Overview
The Cyberduck Clone Project is designed to replicate the core functionalities of Cyberduck, a well-known file transfer application. Due to time constraints, we have implemented essential features primarily on the backend, with limited functionalities on the frontend.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- Next.js
- TypeScript
### Backend
- Flask (Python)
- Linux SSH Server
### How It Works
1. <b>Frontend Requests:</b> The web interface allows users to initiate file transfer requests.
2. <b>Backend Processing:</b> Requests from the frontend are processed by a Flask server.
2. <b>File Transfer:</b> The Flask server interacts with an SSH server installed on a Linux machine to perform file transfer operations.
